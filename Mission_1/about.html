                    When I was 6, I started my primary school. It was a pain back in the day. 
                    Everyday of my life is just going to school in the morning at 7:30,
                    finished school at 3:15pm and back home, homework dinner then sleep. Everyday
                    just cycle the exact same way for 6 years. I was a athlete and swimmer, representative of the school. 
                    My strengths are 60m, 100m, 200m, long jump and 400m relay and 800m relay for
                    athlete and 200m freestyle relay (mix grade and senior grade)

                    I swap three school when I was in junior high. My mom think that my english was not good enough,
                    so I transfer to a private junior high that has an advance english class which is tought by western teacher
                    after a year in public junior high. Putai junior high is a buddhist boarding school, which make me eat grass for 
                    a year. I had a lot of fun over there, had a lot of time playing with my friends.
